# Web Security CTF – 13 Level Walkthrough - Bloomberg x The Knowledge House Hackathon

This repository contains a structured, educational walkthrough of a 13-level web security Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. The CTF was designed to introduce and reinforce foundational concepts in modern web application security, covering topics such as URL manipulation, HTTP request analysis, hidden fields, JavaScript inspection, cookie tampering, JWT logic, NoSQL injection, open redirects, and binary analysis.

Each level in the write-up explains the vulnerability, the approach taken to discover it, the exploitation path, and the broader security lesson behind the challenge.
