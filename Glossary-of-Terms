# 📘 Glossary of Terms

### JavaScript  
A programming language that runs inside your web browser. It controls interactive behavior on websites.

### Minified JavaScript  
A compressed form of JavaScript with removed spaces and formatting to reduce file size. It looks obfuscated but does not provide true security.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)  
A token format used to store user identity and session data. It consists of a header, payload, and signature. The payload is only encoded, not encrypted, which means anyone can read it.

### Base64 Encoding  
A method of converting data into a readable text format using only safe characters. Commonly used inside JWTs and URLs.

### cURL  
A command-line tool for sending web requests without needing a browser. Useful for testing, debugging, and manually crafting HTTP requests.

### Burp Suite  
A web security testing tool that intercepts, modifies, and analyzes traffic between the browser and a server. Frequently used by penetration testers.

### HTTP Headers  
Extra pieces of metadata attached to web requests and responses. They can reveal browser details, session information, origins, or internal server data.

### Cookie  
A small piece of data stored in the browser to remember things like login status, preferences, or session identifiers.

### Origin Header  
A header that indicates where a request originated from. Attackers can spoof this header in tools like cURL to bypass weak server-side validation.

### Stack Trace  
A detailed error message showing the sequence of functions the server executed before an error occurred. Exposing stack traces reveals sensitive backend information.

### NoSQL Injection  
A form of injection attack targeting NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. It manipulates data structures instead of SQL syntax.

### SQL Injection  
An attack where malicious input is added into a SQL query, allowing attackers to bypass login

### URL Parameter  
Information added to the end of a web address to control server behavior. For example: `q=search` or `page=2`.

### Open Redirect  
A flaw where a website blindly redirects users to URLs provided in user-controlled parameters. Can be abused for phishing or malicious redirects.

### URL Encoding  
A method of representing special characters in URLs using percent symbols. For example, "/" becomes "%2F". Double-encoding means encoding characters twice to bypass filters.

### Network Tab (Browser DevTools)  
A tool that shows all files, assets, and requests a web page loads. Useful for discovering hidden resources like images or scripts.

### Strings Command  
A Linux command that extracts readable text from a binary file. Often used to find hidden messages, passwords, or debug information.

### Client-Side Logic  
Code executed directly in the user's browser. It can be viewed and modified by anyone and should never be trusted for security decisions.

### Server-Side Logic  
Code executed on the server. It is secure from user tampering and responsible for authentication, validation, and database operations.

### Hash  
A one-way transformation that turns data into a fixed-length fingerprint. Used to store passwords securely. Hashes cannot be reversed mathematically but can be guessed.

### Dictionary Attack  
A technique where many possible passwords are tried in sequence until the correct one is found.

### Payload  
Any crafted input designed for testing or exploiting a vulnerability, such as malicious URLs, JavaScript, or injection strings.

### Debugger  
A tool that allows step-by-step examination of JavaScript code as it runs. Helpful for understanding obfuscated or complex client-side logic.
